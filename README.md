Note: masscan must be installed for this to work. Made for Linux.

I must point out that this will scan ports 80 and 443 on many devices connected to the internet. This puts you in a legal gray area, however I beleve this is not malicious and you are unlikely to be reported. It must be noted, however that you may be flagged on sites such as abuseipdb.com or by your ISP if you scan too many ips. I would reccomend reading https://nmap.org/book/legal-issues.html for a more informed view on the matter.

Very easy to use. You can change scan peramiters in the shell executable file.

How to use:

1| Git clone the repo

2| Run mkwebpage.sh

The terminal will tell you what's what after this.

I am aware my code is bad and can sometimes leave double quotes but I don't have the time or brain function to fix it.
